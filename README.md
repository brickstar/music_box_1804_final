User Stories
We are going to add Genres to our Music Box application, and song Ratings. Genres will be similar to the "Categories" we started building. You will not change any of the category work we previously did, the genre code will be 100% new code.

A genre requires a name attribute, which is a string.

A song rating is an integer value, stored in the songs table, from 1 to 5 and should default to 0. It is not a 'required' field, so previous tests should not break.

You are expected to fully test all new validations and relationships at the model level
A song can have more than one genre (example: "Open Arms" by Journey might be linked to several genres like "Classic Rock", "Ballad", etc) and a genre can be used for many different songs. Please test for this functionality in your models, too.

Here's a list of music genres you can use for testing, or you can make up your own:

Dance	Theater	Rock
Folk	Jazz	Classical
Country	Hip Hop	Techno
Opera	Funk	Disco
